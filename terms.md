# Terms

As the `When Then Zen` project attempts to extract techniques out of esoteric sources  
In order to make these accessible to people who don't subscribe to metaphysical views  
Given an open mind and a willingness to learn  
And the willingness to try things that may lead you out of your comfort zone  
When you read the features in this repository  
Then this document contains terms and plain English definitions.

This project aims to target the average software developer, and as such terms 
such as `stateful` and `side effects` will be used.

## Meditation

Meditation is some action that improves state of being somehow, be it by a 
specific kind of relaxation method or other generic work to improve well
being. There are many different methods of meditation, some of them are 
explained in ways that are clearer or less clearer for outsiders to understand.

This definition is incredibly vague, but intentionally so. This is because 
meditation itself is kind of a nebulous concept. This project intends to remove
a lot of the barriers to understanding meditation methods, but every person 
will end up creating their own method based on parts of others combined.

## Side Effects

Side effects are the events that happen as a result of state-changing actions
in programs. An example of a side effect is printing data to the standard out
file descriptor. 

## State

State is effectively equivalent to human memory in the context of computer
programs. An example JavaScript program that manages state follows:

```javascript
// number is set to zero
let number = 0;

// number is incremented to one
number = number + 1;

// prints `1`
console.log(number); 
```

The variable named `number` is the state of this code.

## The Body

The body refers to the body that you, the reader, are currently living inside.
This guide to meditation takes the stance that a person has some kind of 
inner core essence of some kind (of which is largely irrelevant for the
explanation of the majority of the techniques in this repository, any features
that actually do benefit from those metaphors to explain the technique will
have the metaphor and a detailed explanation as to what the metaphor is 
signifying and how to understand it).

This helps when explaining anapana meditation among other things, referring
to the body in the third person sets a sort of "soft" expectation that 
something else is controlling the breathing. The thing that is controlling the
breathing (likely your subconscious) doesn't matter, just the fact that 
**SOMETHING** is.
