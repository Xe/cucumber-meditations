# When Then Zen

When Then Zen is a new project by [Christine Dodrill](https://christine.website) to offer a better way to teach meditation. Meditation has gotten a really bad reputation in Western audiences as overcomplicated, esoteric and baroque; however those couldn't be farther from the truth. It can be as simple as watching breathing happen or build off of there. 

If this interests you, please check out the [introduction](/intro) and feel free to look at the [meditation](/meditation) or [skill](/skills) guides.

Thanks for reading, I hope this can help.

Be well, Creator.
