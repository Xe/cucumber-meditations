# Feature: Social Breath Counting

This feature contains social breath counting exercises that have been tried
and proven in small (2-3) and large (6-8) groups. If in a larger group, be
sure to increase the count cap to a larger number, keep it less than 15 to
help avoid the numbers popping out of people's short-term memory (this can
be waived depending on the group, practice will give you the context you
need to understand this the best).

## Background:

> Given no assumption about meditation background for any participant  
> And an open mind  
> And a willingness to learn
  
## Scenario: 10 Minute Social Breath Counting (participant)

> As a participant  
> In order to be mindful of the body's breath  
> Given I maintain a counter of breaths  
> And I take a nice, peaceful breath in at my own pace  
> When I exhale, at the end of the exhale  
> Then I increment the counter and speak the newly updated value  
> But if someone else speaks at the same time  
> Then I continue as if nothing happened  
> But I don't increment the counter  
> Then if the counter hits ten, the next number is one  
> Then repeat until the organizer ends the session
  
## Scenario: 10 Minute Social Breath Counting (organizer)

> As an organizer  
> In order to help facilitate the participant's breath counting  
> Given I set a timer for ten minutes somehow  
> And I start it when everyone is ready  
> And I start the process of counting breaths  
> When something interferes and people get out of flow  
> Then I will help guide the group back into mindfulness  
> When the timer goes off  
> Then I will silence it ASAP  
> Then I will help lead the group to the next count of 10  
> Then I will end the session  
> Then I will talk with the participants about their meditative path  
> But I will not judge their stories
