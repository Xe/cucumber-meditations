# Feature: Social Noting

Noting of sensations is a very meditatively relaxing thing to do. At a high
level it is very simple. Everyone continuously pays attention to the 
sensations they experience, and when it is their turn they say out loud what
the sensation is.

Early on in the process, it is useful to limit descriptions to the six 
senses:

- Touch
- Taste
- Sight
- Sound
- Scent
- Thought

After people have gotten used to the act of noting things socially, you can
open this up for more detailed descriptions. If you are sensing touch from
a laptop, it could be noted as metal or smooth. 

After each social noting session, talk with the participants about what they
felt, what helped them get into flow and what brought them out of flow. The
facilitator should make sure everyone who wants to say something gets to say
it. 

Repeat the five minute noting session and debrief twice in a session.

## Scenario: Positive Intent

> As a facilitator  
> In order to establish the postitive intent of this session  
> Given a rough idea of the group you are leading for  
> When you establish the positive intent  
> Then you target the group with it  
> And let your positive intent guide the session  
 
This is as simple as saying out loud or in mindvoice "With this group meditation session, I intend to help the group understand themeslves" or similar. Adjust as needed based on the topicality of the group in question and the context of the world that day in general.

In a pinch just target them with metta.

## Scenario: Brief

    As a facilitator
    In order to help the group prepare for the meditation
    When I am explaining this exercise
    Then I will go over part of the instructions above
    But make sure everyone understands what to do
  
## Scenario: Five minute social noting (meditator)
    As a meditator
    In order to note sensations as a group
    Given the timer has started
    When it is my turn
    Then I sense sensations
    And I note the sensation I am experiencing
    But if I can't give a word to it I pass
    And it goes to the next person in order
   
## Scenario: Five minute social noting (facilitator)
    As a facilitator
    In order to help the group note sensations
    Given everyone is ready
    And I have established an order
    And a timer is set for five minutes
    When I start the timer
    Then I sense for sensations
    And I note the sensation
    And the next person continues
    
  Scenario: Debrief (meditator)
    As a meditator
    In order to help the group understand the session
    Given questions or experiences to report
    When it is my turn
    Then I ask my question or relay my experiences
    And I help answer others questions when I can
    # experiences when meditating are subjective, man
    But I don't judge
    And I don't interrupt
    
  Scenario: Debrief (facilitator)
    As a facilitator
    In order to help the group understand the session
    Given an order of people to ask
    When you ask someone
    Then you wait for them to reply
    And tell us about their experiences
    And if you have any insight that may help
    Then you share it freely
